# Pygame module

Pygame is a module created for Python to generate a game with Python programming. `pygame.init()` initializes Pygame and allows the pygame module to run within the program. THere are several modules available within Pygame:
- 'cdrom': Lets you access the CD and DVD drives of a computer to load things, such as audio recordings and etc. Outdated  
- `cursors`: Lets you use and display cursors in your program for any purpose, such as menu selection  
- `display`: Lets you create a display (screen) for your game. Called a 'surface' by Pygame, this is where you display your game to the user  
- `draw`: Lets you 'draw' shapes onto a surface (display)  
- `event`: Lets you manage events and the event queue    
- `font`: Lets you create and render custom TrueType fonts for your program  
- `image`: Lets you save and load images  
- `joystick`: Lets you use a joystick in your game  
- `key`: Lets you bind events to keyboard buttons and perform other functions with the keyboard  
- `mouse`: Lets you bind events to the mouse movement and state and perform other mouse functions  
- `sndarray`: Use the NumPy module to convert Sound objects with a NumPy array. Allows manipulation of sound values and functions to manipulate sound  
- `surfarray`: Use the NumPy module to convert pixels to a NumPy array. Allows manipulation of image pixels and colours.  
- `time`: Lets you handle program timings in milliseconds  
- `transform`: Lets you manipulate images and sprites on the display. Note that some data can be lost if an image is resized over and over, resulting in a more blurry image
