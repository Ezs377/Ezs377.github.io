Glossary:  
\<text> = Can be anything, as long as it fits the word. E.g. \<variable> means any variable name  
`text` = Written as it is. For expressing code. E.g. `git status` means that’s what you input  
“text” = Focus on the text inside the brackets. Text inside the brackets are together and aren’t separated. E.g. “If y = 5:” means a line of code that says `If y = 5:`
