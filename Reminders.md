Java is installed on my current laptop in D drive and has an environmental variable implemented (JAVA-HOME).

"Java stuff" folder in "School stuff" folder has some random useful mini-code for referencing

Adobe Illustrator:  
- The pen tool can draw straight lines by clicking two points or make a curving line by holding and dragging on the second point. It can also make new anchor points by clicking on a path
- The selector mouse cursor can move anchor points which is useful for making small edits, as well as round corners by zooming in and dragging the small dot that shows up in a corner
- The scissor tool can section lines which is useful for removing excesses or line drawings
- For laser cutting (specifically at UoA) use black for engraving, with darker black being deeper engraving. Red (pure R, i.e. 255, 0, 0 RGB) lines for cutting, needs to be in smallest stroke size, i.e. 0.0001 mm. The For engraving it will cover anything that is black.
