### PROGRAMMING KNOWLEDGE
**Programming paradigms:**
A programming paradigm is a method of writing code for a program. Paradigms present ways for programmers to write their code in a certain way that makes it easier to do a certain thing with the code (e.g. Debugging). 

List of common paradigms:

The programming paradigms can be classified into 2 major groups:

**Imperative Programming Paradigm:** This paradigm is based on telling the program HOW to do things. For example, writing the code so that it can perform maths by telling the program that 1 + 1 = 2, or use a loop to tell the program to keep repeating a certain block of code. Usually, this means having to manually write the algorithms, formulas, etc in the code so the program can follow it and perform its task. This usually means more code is written in the program, but step-by-step coding means that it’s easier to find errors and debug. The types of paradigms that follow this particular paradigm are:

- **Procedural Programming Paradigm:** This paradigm utilises blocks of code that tell the program how to do a certain task by writing code step-by-step. Similar to functions, except where functions usually return a value, a procedure is simply a list of instructions for the program. Examples of procedures include While loops, For loops, etc. This paradigm is mostly associated with programs that require other developers to be able to easily view the code without being confused or the program isn’t going to be updated with new code for a while.
- Advantages: 
  - Easier to follow code 
  - Simpler to program
  - Efficient memory usage
 
- Disadvantages:
  - Everything has to work together properly
  - A single change to part of the code might mean everything else has to be changed
  - Code becomes more complicated the longer it gets, meaning it becomes less efficient for large programs (as in, professional business programs, high standard video games, etc).
  - It becomes more difficult for other programmers to work together to create the program, as each programmer will program in a different way, which messes with the program as a whole.
  - Code is programmed a certain way, so it is usually very difficult to combine other programs with the code.
**Object Oriented Programming:** This paradigm utilises classes to create objects that are used by the program to run. An 
**Parallel Processing Approach:**

**Declarative Programming Paradigm:** This paradigm is based on telling the program WHAT to do. Instead of Imperative Programming, where the code is based on telling the program how to perform, Declarative Programming is based on letting the program know what needs to be done for the program to work. Usually this is done by functions or pre-built methods that are written in the code instead of writing the whole set of instructions. This shortens the amount of code used in the program, but can make it harder to debug as code is ‘hidden’ behind functions and etc. The types of paradigms that follow this particular paradigm are:
**Logic Programming Paradigm:**
**Functional Programming:**
**Database Processing Approach:**

**Data:**

**Languages:**
