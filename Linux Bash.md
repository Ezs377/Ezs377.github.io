Linux BASH
Getting Bash:
Bash is a linux command line and provides a Unix shell, which is generally used for the Linux operating system. There are currently 3 major operating systems for computers: Windows, Mac, and Linux. Mac and Linux are based on an old operating system called Unix which was really popular when computers became commercially available. Knowing how to use Bash is useful as it introduces you to Linux, which is considered a favorable toolset by programmers as Linux is considered more secure and stable than Windows. This makes it favorable for remote servers and networking tools, which are essential for the internet and websites. Linux is also open sourced, unlike Windows which is commercial, meaning that anyone can access source code of Linux and make modifications to it. However, this also improves Linux’s security as it makes it much harder for hackers to adapt to each user’s unique modifications, while Window’s software is kept the same for all products making it easier to eventually break through. It also means Linux can be modified to suit different environments, such as setting up a personal server for yourself, or setting up a network for a company. Linux is mostly successful because of its ‘sharing’ ideology. Linux is given for practically free to anyone, who can edit it and improve on it, and as more people use Linux it gets better, adapting to the technological arms race. Windows has better software, Mac is better at CPU-heavy tasks such as graphic design and music, Linux has the advantage of modification. Mac and Windows are commercial so you can’t edit their software, but Linux can be changed to anything you want as long as you can do it. Modified Linux versions are often referred to as distributions or ‘distros’, which are modified versions of Linux that people have made and produced for others, either for free or at a cost. Linux is written in C (the programming language), and Ubuntu is an easy Linux distribution that is supposedly easy for beginners to learn Linux if you want (I haven’t checked). 

But Bash is not Linux. Bash is a shell that utilises the same software base as Linux, which is why learning to use Bash is useful for Linux users. Linux operating systems will often use Bash as their command line anyway. A shell is basically a software-to-text interface that lets people see what’s going on in their computer, which is Bash. Windows has command prompt, but this is mostly for accessing commands that aren’t commonly used. Learning Bash makes you get used to its commands which are slightly different to Windows. 

Back to Linux. Aside from security, stability, and adaptability, Linux can also run on most hardware, including Mac and Windows without the use of an emulator! As Linux is used for remote servers, practically any device connected to the internet needs to be able to run Linux, ranging from supercomputers, to Windows, to Android, and even Google uses Linux software for their servers. Since you can run Linux on pretty much anything, you can do anything that a Linux computer could on that device (within its processing limits). There’s stories of people running Linux on an Ipod, or installing Linux on a USB stick then plugging that into another device to run Linux from anything. Aside from software, Linux is also known to be used in other devices, such as traffic control systems, plane computers, smart TVs, car systems, and more. I am working on too much to look into Linux, but it is a really useful skill for future technologies, as it is currently being used for supercomputers.

Please keep in mind that Linux is a kernel, not a whole operating system. Linux works with GNU, another free, open-source software that is based on Unix. The development history of these softwares will help make sense of the 2 softwares (basically a guy made software that emulated a commercial software (Unix), and another guy added more onto his code, creating the Linux-GNU operating system, I can explain more if you really want).  Basically, GNU is the main operating system, while Linux (a kernel) sets permissions for other software and programs, allowing them to access the operating software to work with hardware or denying access. GNU is like the kitchen tools, and Linux is the chef that uses the kitchen to do stuff (which are programs). 

Linux Bash commands:
Ls/dir: List all files in current directory
Mkdir: Make new directory
help: List commands
cd: Change directory. Type ‘cd’ only to move back to main directory. Use ‘ ..’ to move back to previous directory. Use ‘ -’ to switch between last directory and current.
echo: Print a text
touch: Create a new file
grep: Search for a string in a file
man: Help manual for commands
pwd: Print the current working directory (echo the current directory)
mv: Rename/move a directory
rmdir: Remove an empty directory
rm: Remove/delete files
locate: Search for a file
less: View a text file
compgen: View all commands
cat: Read, create, or merge files (?)
head: Read the first few lines of a file
tail: Read the last few lines of a file
exit: Quit the Bash
history: View past commands
clear: Clear the terminal
cp: Copy files
sleep: Delay a process for determined length of time (seconds)
alias: Create an alias. Aliases are used as functions that run the series of commands from calling one variable/label. For example, alias c = ‘clear’ will execute the command clear everytime c is used in the command line

Using tab will autofill file names that have been already typed in, rather than cycling through all the files.
Join words using \ when navigating files, instead of putting the whole string in quotation marks (eg. ‘Speeding camera assessment’ becomes ‘Speeding\ camera\ assessment’
